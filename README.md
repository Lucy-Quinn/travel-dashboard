## **Overview**

This project was created as part of my preparation for an interview, where one of the key requirements was **experience with chart libraries**, specifically **ECharts**. Since I had not used ECharts before, I decided to build this **mini-project** to gain hands-on experience and be well-prepared for the interview.

Additionally, I wanted to incorporate my **recent learnings about Next.js Server Actions and Forms**, applying them in a **real-world scenario** alongside ECharts.

## **Features**

- üìä **Data Visualization with ECharts** ‚Äì Implemented interactive charts for data representation.
- üåç **Fetching Data from Amadeus Travel API** ‚Äì Retrieved and displayed travel-related insights.
- ‚ö° **Next.js Server Actions** ‚Äì Handled API requests efficiently on the server.
- üéõÔ∏è **React Hook Form & Headless UI** ‚Äì Enhanced user interaction for selecting cities dynamically.

## **Why This Project?**

1. Gain **practical experience** with **ECharts**, the preferred charting library for the role.
2. Implement **Next.js Server Actions**, a feature I recently learned.
3. Strengthen my understanding of **React Hook Form & Headless UI** for modern form handling.
4. Develop a structured approach for consuming and visualizing **real-world API data**.

## **Travel Bar Chart**

### Overview

The Travel Bar Chart project visualizes recommended travel destinations based on popularity. It uses the Amadeus API to fetch recommended locations for a given city.

### Features

- Displays a bar chart of recommended destinations with popularity percentages.
- Utilizes the Amadeus API for fetching data: [Recommended Locations API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/flights/api-doc/travel-recommendations/api-reference).

---

## **Travel Geo Map**

### Overview

The Travel Geo Map project visualizes flight destinations on a world map, including flight prices and geocoordinates. It uses two Amadeus APIs to gather the necessary data.

### Features

- Displays a world map with flight destinations and prices.
- Fetches flight destination data with prices using the [Flight Inspiration Search API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/flights/api-doc/flight-inspiration-search/api-reference).
- Retrieves geocoordinates and other relevant details using the [Airport and City Search API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/flights/api-doc/airport-and-city-search/api-reference).
- The geo map was set up by downloading a map from [GeoJSON Maps](https://geojson-maps.kyd.au/?utm_source=self&utm_medium=redirect) and adding it to the public folder.

---

## **Known Issues**

- Occasionally, API rate limits may cause data fetching errors.
